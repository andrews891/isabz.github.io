                <p>Improvements in computing has allowed scientists to predict when natural hazards will occur more
                    accurately and reliably. In the past, it was virtually impossible to predict when disasters such as
                    earthquakes would strike however nowadays computers are able to process realtime data from multiple
                    sensors and detect patterns that would indicate disaster. These devices can save a lot of lives by
                    warning people and the government to imminent threats to their lives and property ahead of time</p>

                <h2>Winter Road Safety</h2>
                <p>Gritting the road properly can be a very difficult task as humans are having to guess where to apply
                    the grit. The advancement of computing has now enabled a tech company to develop a phone sized
                    device that detects areas without any grit on roads. It uses radar to gather data from the road
                    surface and then analyses the data to detect which areas of the road is most slippy. This technology
                    will make the roads safer since
                    there will be less slippy patches on the roads while also reducing the cost of gritting for tax
                    payers as the grit is being applied more efficiently. Moreover this device can also detect potholes
                    forming in the road, allowing them to be patched up before causing any damage to vehicles driving
                    over it.</p>
