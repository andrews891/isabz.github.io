    <h2>How has computer science effected the medical industry</h2>
    <p>Many technological solutions have been proposed and tested for several problems that the world of medicine was facing, and these have greatly changed and improved the medicine industry. There have been many breakthroughs in data collection, treatments, research, and medical devices such as hearing aids which have had a huge impact on the World of Medicine.</p>

        <h3>3D Printing</h3>
        
        <p>
        Today, it is possible to reproduce bones and some internal organs using 3D printing technology. These artificial organs and bones can then be introduced into the body of the patient to replace diseased or problematic areas.</p>
        
        <p>
        Surgeons are also using 3D printing technology to have a better understanding of what is happening inside their patientsâ€™ bodies. With a 3D model, it is significantly easier for a surgeon to have a closer look at the problem and simulate a variety of solutions or possible operations that can be undertaken before performing the actual surgery on the patient.</p>

        <p>
        Similarly, 3D printing has revolutionized prosthetics. With a 3D printer, getting a customized prosthetic hand or leg is significantly cheaper. It is now possible to custom print prosthetic hands, for example, for a child that needs different models as they grow, instead of having to go out and get a new prosthetic hand fitted every year. Plus, with the massive developments that are being made in the 3D printing industry, the costs associated with this technology are reducing every day.
